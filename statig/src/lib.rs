/// Macro for deriving the state and superstate enum.
///
/// By parsing the underlying `impl` block and searching for methods with the
/// `state`, `superstate` or `action` attribute, the `state_machine` macro can
/// derive the state and superstate enums. By default these will be given the
/// names '`State`' and '`Superstate`'. Next to that the macro will also
/// implement the [`State`](crate::blocking::State) trait for the state enum and the
/// [`Superstate`](crate::blocking::Superstate) trait for the superstate enum.
///
/// To override the default configuration you can use the following attributes.
///
/// - `#[state_machine(state(name = "CustomStateName"))]`
///
///   Set the name of the state enum to a custom name.
///
///   _Default_: `State`
///
///   <br/>
///
/// - `#[state_machine(superstate(name = "CustomSuperstateName"))]`
///
///   Set the name of the superstate enum to a custom name.
///
///   _Default_: `Superstate`
///
///   <br/>
///
/// - `#[state_machine(state(derive(SomeTrait, AnotherTrait)))]`
///
///   Apply the derive macro with the passed traits to the state enum.
///
///   _Default_: `()`
///
///   <br/>
///
/// - `#[state_machine(superstate(derive(SomeTrait, AnotherTrait)))]`
///
///   Apply the derive macro with the passed traits to the superstate enum.
